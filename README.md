# Bearable Youtube Ads

Somewhat content creator friendly extension that helps you auto-skip skippable YouTube video ads and auto-close video banner ads. The extension skips any skippable pre-roll video ads that appear within YouTube. Also helps you auto-close any banner ads that appear at the bottom of the video. The aim of this extension is to not hurt content creators (atleast the ones using CPM) while still not annoying users with constant bombardment of ads on the video.

Any ads that appear anywhere else on the page will not be removed by this extension.
